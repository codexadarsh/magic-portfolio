## Overview

This project is a full-stack job portal built with the MERN stack. The goal was simple and practical: create a system where users can create, read, update and delete jobs and applications, using a clean API layer and a responsive React frontend.

I treated it like a real product: separate concerns between frontend and backend, design a clear data model for jobs and applications, and make the UI fast and easy to work with for both job posters and candidates. The project also serves as a solid reference for how I structure full-stack apps from scratch.

## Key Features

- **Job Management (CRUD)**  
  Create, list, update and delete job postings with fields like title, company, location, salary range and description.

- **Application Management (CRUD)**  
  For each job, manage applications with candidate details and status updates, using the same RESTful patterns as the jobs module.

- **Structured API Layer**  
  A Node.js + Express backend that exposes clear routes for jobs and applications, with proper request validation and error handling.

- **Responsive UI**  
  A React-based frontend with reusable components for forms, lists and detail views, designed to work well on both desktop and mobile.

- **State Management & Data Fetching**  
  Clean separation between UI and data fetching using hooks, making it easier to extend or replace parts of the app later.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – For building the component-based frontend and handling state and routing.
- **Node.js & Express.js** – For creating the REST API, routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB** – For storing jobs and applications with flexible schemas.
- **Mongoose** – For defining models and handling database operations.
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and project collaboration.
- **Vercel** – For deploying the frontend (and optionally the backend, if configured as serverless functions).

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was designing the data model and API in a way that stays simple but doesn’t paint me into a corner later.

- **Data modeling**: I had to decide how to link jobs and applications (referencing vs embedding), and ended up with a structure that keeps relations clear while still being easy to query.
- **Error handling**: Building proper error responses (validation errors, not found, server errors) forced me to think through edge cases instead of assuming “happy path” flows.
- **API and UI alignment**: Any backend change (field names, response structure) immediately affected the frontend. This pushed me to define contracts up front and stick to them.

These constraints made the project feel closer to real-world work than just a simple CRUD demo.

## Outcome

The job portal delivers a complete flow for managing jobs and applications end to end:

- Recruiter-style users can create and manage job listings.
- Application data is stored and retrievable via a consistent API.
- The frontend remains readable and maintainable, with clear separation between UI and data logic.

More importantly, this project shows how I approach full-stack work: start from the data model and API design, build a clean React UI on top of it, and keep the whole thing deployable and easy to extend.
