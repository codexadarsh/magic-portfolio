## Overview

The Movie Discovery App is a frontend-focused project built to explore modern React patterns for data fetching, search performance, and UI responsiveness. The goal was to create a fast, minimal interface where users can search for movies, explore details, and scroll through results without hitting bottlenecks or slow re-renders.

This project also served as a playground for improving user experience: subtle animations, skeleton loaders, debounced search, infinite scrolling, and clean component composition.

## Key Features

- **Live Movie Search (with Debouncing)**  
  The search input uses a debounced fetch so the API isn't spammed on every keystroke. Fast, responsive, and efficient.

- **Infinite Scroll**  
  As users scroll, new results load automatically—no pagination buttons, no reloads. Smooth and uninterrupted discovery.

- **Movie Detail Pages**  
  Every movie includes detailed info: rating, description, cast, release year, and poster images.

- **Mood-Based Recommendations**  
  A simple but effective recommendation engine that filters based on user-selected moods (action, chill, dramatic, etc.).

- **Responsive UI Built from Scratch**  
  No heavy UI libraries. Just clean components, controlled states, and modern layout techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – Component-based UI with hooks for managing state and fetching.
- **TMDB API** (or compatible API) – For movie data including images and metadata.
- **CSS / Tailwind (if used)** – Fast styling, custom layouts, and responsive pages.
- **Vercel** – For deploying the production build quickly and efficiently.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Preventing Over-Fetching**  
  Without debouncing, the API was getting hit multiple times per second. Fixing this taught me to handle real-world API efficiency concerns.

- **Managing State Without Over-Engineering**  
  Instead of reaching for Redux or Zustand immediately, I learned how far React’s built-in tools can go when structured cleanly.

- **Image Performance**  
  Large poster images can choke a feed. Optimizing image loading and using responsive sizes made a noticeable difference.

- **Cleaning Up Side-Effects**  
  Race conditions in async search calls were causing flickers until I implemented proper cancellation/guards.

## Outcome

The final app is fast, lightweight, and genuinely enjoyable to use. Search feels instant, scrolling is seamless, and the UI stays consistent across devices.

More importantly, this project demonstrates strong frontend fundamentals:  
clean state management, API integration, performance-first thinking, and UI polish without unnecessary complexity.
